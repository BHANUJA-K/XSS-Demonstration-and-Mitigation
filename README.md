XSS Vulnerability Demonstration & Mitigation
Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications and educate developers on how to identify and mitigate such security threats. The web application consists of a Home Page with insights on XSS and a Contact Page that showcases both vulnerable and secure implementations of input handling.

Features
âœ… XSS Simulation â€“ Showcases how malicious scripts can exploit input fields.
âœ… Mitigation Strategies â€“ Implements input validation, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent attacks.
âœ… Responsive Design â€“ Uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for a modern UI.
âœ… Interactive Demonstration â€“ Allows users to test attack vectors and understand security risks.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Security Techniques: Input Sanitization, CSP, Output Encoding

Vulnerabilities Demonstrated
ðŸ”´ Stored XSS â€“ Demonstrates how malicious scripts persist in a web application.
ðŸ”´ Reflected XSS â€“ Shows real-time script execution in user input fields.

Mitigation Techniques Implemented
ðŸŸ¢ Input Validation â€“ Restricts input types to prevent script execution.
ðŸŸ¢ Output Encoding â€“ Escapes special characters to neutralize script execution.
ðŸŸ¢ Content Security Policy (CSP) â€“ Prevents unauthorized script execution.
